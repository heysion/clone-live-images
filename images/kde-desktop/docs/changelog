debian-kde-desktop (7.0~b1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Building with live-build version 3.0~b1-1.
  * Updating upstream name in copyright file.
  * Removing compression from auto/config, unecessary with newer live-
    build.
  * Updating config tree description in README.source.
  * Adding console-setup to localization package list.
  * Updating project name in changelog.
  * Adding hook to set plymouth default theme.
  * Adding debian-installer-launcher package.
  * Excluding plymouth on wheezy, it has a mistaken conflict against
    console-tools instead of console-common which makes it uninstallable
    in this setting.
